# Trading Bot with Q-Learning: Trend Predictor

## Abstract

The primary focus of this research is to predict the likely behaviors of the stock market (bullish, bearish, and sideways) using the Q-Learning algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). Accurate stock market analysis and forecasting are crucial for organizations and investors to make informed decisions and stay competitive in dynamic markets and an ever-evolving business landscape. The proposed framework, called "Trend Predictor," is designed to analyze market trends, predict future market behavior, and facilitate strategic decision-making.

So, this sept is to understand the level of accuracy we can get with the change of hyperparameters.

## I. Introduction

The Market Predictor framework integrates various data-driven techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of historical and current market data. By leveraging advanced algorithms and computational methods, Market Predictor effectively identifies patterns, correlations, and dependencies within the data, generating reliable predictions about market behavior.

The algorithm learns optimal actions based on feedback from the following economic factors: RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) of the current environment. It maximizes reward signals (profit) by taking different actions (buy, sell, hold) in various market conditions. The agent, referred to as "Trend Predictor," interacts with the market environment and receives rewards or penalties based on its trading decisions.

**1. RSI (Relative Strength Index):** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It provides a numerical value that oscillates between 0 and 100, indicating the strength and direction of a price trend. The RSI is typically used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in an asset's price.

**2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that calculates the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the asset's price. It helps to identify the strength and direction of a price trend and provides potential entry and exit signals.
